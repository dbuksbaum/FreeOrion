 \section mod_overview Overview

  The purpose of the Empire module is to manage information related to the overall
  state of each Empire in a FreeOrion game.  Information handled by the Empire module
  will include: 
	- All planets, fleets, etc that are owned by the Empire.
	- Events currently in the empire's sitrep
	- An empire's accumulated research and technological advancement.
	- A list of star systems explored by the empire.

  And, In later revisions:
	- racial advantages
	- diplomatic status
	- whatever else they decide to make us add... :)

  The Empire module is also responsible for managing "global" data such as
  technology research fields, ship designs, etc. etc.


 \section classes Major Classes

 The Empire class will be the most fundamental class to the empire module.  It encapsulates
 the state of a single empire at any point during the game.  Empires are created and managed
 by EmpireManager objects.  Other modules which need to manipulate Empire objects must
 first obtain a pointer to the object from an EmpireManager.

 Other FreeOrion modules will interact with the Empire module through the EmpireManager class
 (actually, through a subclass of EmpireManager).  The EmpireManagers have methods for looking
 up specific empires based on their unique numeric identifiers.  In addition, the ServerEmpire
 manager has the ability to create XML updates for transmission to clients between turns 
 (to keep the client empire state in sync with the rest of the game).  The ClientEmpire manager 
 is able to process these updates and bring itself in sync with the server.

 A similar object manager pattern is used for technology items.  The TechLevel class is used to
 represent a particular field of technological progress, and it is created and managed by a TechManager
 object.  These objects may be used by both client and server to provide controlled access to the technologies
 that will eventually be incorporated into FreeOrion.  For Version 0.1, the TechManager creates hardcoded
 TechLevels and provides access to these.

/**
 \page tools Build Instructions
 The standard FreeOrion toolset is required to build the Empire module.
 This includes the following: 
   - The gcc compiler, version 3.0 or higher
   - Expat 1.95.5
   - Boost 1.30.0
   - log4cpp 0.2.7
   - any others I may have missed.  (Please jump in people)

  It is assumed that your include directories are set up such that:
	- GG is a subdirectory of the root include directory.
	- GG contains a subdirectory, XML, with XML related includes stored there.
	- There is an include directory defined with Empire-related includes at its root
	  (i.e.  #include "Empire.h" will work)

  This is the central documentation nexus for the Empire Module.  The Empire module
  is a component of the FreeOrion project (see http://www.FreeOrion.org ).
  Documentation and updates of interest to the Empire team will be posted here.   
  
  
  I'm sorry there are so many annoying Empire hyperlinks, but I can't figure
  out how to get Doxygen to not make links unless I use that verbatim thingie
  and that makes things ugly.
