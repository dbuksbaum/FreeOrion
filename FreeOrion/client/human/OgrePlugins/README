These files were copied here straight out of the Ogre source tree.  These
headers are needed for producing a statically-linked Linux build.  They must
be manually kept in sync with the version of Ogre used to compile FreeOrion.

The files (recursively) copied from the Ogre source tree were:

ogre/PlugIns/CgProgramManager/include/*.h
ogre/PlugIns/OctreeSceneManager/include/*.h
ogre/PlugIns/ParticleFX/include/*.h
ogre/RenderSystems/GL/include/*.h
ogre/RenderSystems/GL/src/GLSL/include/*.h

except for the conflicting OpenGL headers supplied by Ogre were removed:

ogre/RenderSystems/GL/include/*gl*.h
