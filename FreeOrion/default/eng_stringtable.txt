FREEORION_VISION
FreeOrion, an open-source game based on Master of Orion, is a turn-based game of epic space strategy that builds on the classic '4X' model by incorporating the nation-building elements of games such as Europa Universalis 2 and a versatile tactical combat engine. While its modular, open-source design allows for a significant degree of customization of the game engine and the story elements by the community, the FreeOrion team is dedicated to the construction of a living, breathing universe in a 'grand campaign' model.

# Tech Names & Descriptions #
#############################

LRN_PHYS_BRAIN
The Physical Brain
LRN_PHYS_BRAIN_DESC
The stuctures and their functions in the brain are determined.  The electrochemical and quantum nature of thought and memory are exposed.  With understanding, alteration and augmentation of brain functions becomes possible, and new ideas are spawned at the frontiers of thought, its expression, and its replacement.
LRN_ALGO_ELEGANCE
Algorithmic Elegance
LRN_ALGO_ELEGANCE_DESC
With greater and greater difficulty of data analysis problems, traditional measures of algorithm performance become less useful due to the limitations of irreducible complexity.  At this stage, other measures of algorithm form and function become significant; aesthetically and metaphorically, the elegance of the solution must be optimized.
LRN_GAL_EXPLO
Galactic Exploration
LRN_GAL_EXPLO_DESC
The discovery of interstellar travel via starlanes ushers in a new age of development in societies.  Old paradigms and petty squabbles between minor factions become insignificant when the entire civilization is faced with the limitless potential of the stars... for growth, or destruction.
LRN_TRANSLING_THT
Translinguistic Thought
LRN_TRANSLING_THT_DESC
Lesser minds struggle with, or accept the confines of the language they have learned. Adequate minds reach and feel constrained by the concepts they are given ways to express. Truely great minds break free of the bounds of language, forming and analyzing thoughts that verge on the transcendental. But merely great minds are left isolated and futile, for without language to express thoughts, how can they share their insights?
LRN_PSIONICS
Psionics
LRN_PSIONICS_DESC
Telepathy, Empathy, Clairvoyance, Prescience, Mind Control, Possesion, Psychokinesis & Psychoenergitics.
LRN_ARTIF_MINDS
Artificial Minds
LRN_ARTIF_MINDS_DESC
HAL never makes mistakes
LRN_XENOARCH
Xenoarchaeology
LRN_XENOARCH_DESC
Oooh! Pretty oblilesk.
LRN_GRAVITONICS
Gravitonics
LRN_GRAVITONICS_DESC
Up is down, down is sideways, sideways is backwards, nowhere is straight...?
LRN_EVERYTHING
Theory of Everything
LRN_EVERYTHING_DESC
Unification of Quantum Gravity with Grand Unified Theory.  All classic forces are described, and equivalent under certain ultrasymetric conditions.
LRN_FORCE_FIELD
Force-Field Harmonics
LRN_FORCE_FIELD_DESC
Like Fourier analysis of sound, electromagnetism, strong and weak forces may be expressed as harmonic quantum standing-wave superpositions of force-carrier particles.  By selectively amplifying these harmonics, forces may be arbitrarily controlled to shield, attack, contain or support.
LRN_MIND_VOID
Mind of the Void
LRN_MIND_VOID_DESC
We are not alone in the cosmos... but why should the search be so limited?  Perhaps the universe itself is alive, aware, watching.
LRN_TIME_MECH
Temporal Mechanics
LRN_TIME_MECH_DESC
1234321010101654321210303502340231501235123401234
LRN_NDIM_SUBSPACE
N-Dimensional Subspace
LRN_NDIM_SUBSPACE_DESC
Early superstring theorists spoke of 10, 11 or 26 dimensional universes, with all but the 4 macrodimensions "curled up" so tightly as to be unseen.  These other dimensions may now be uncurled and opened, by shifting into levels of existance previously hidden below the surface of our limited perception.
LRN_MATTER_ENERGY
Matter-Energy Conversion
LRN_MATTER_ENERGY_DESC
Transporters & Replicators!  WOO!
LRN_UNIF_CONC
Unified Consciousness
LRN_UNIF_CONC_DESC
Know about the mind of the void + manipulate fields = combine brains, optionally with the universe itself
LRN_TRANSCEND
Singularity of Transcendence

Woah!  My hands are so big, man!
