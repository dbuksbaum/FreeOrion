FREEORION_VISION
FreeOrion, an open-source game based on Master of Orion, is a turn-based game of epic space strategy that builds on the classic '4X' model by incorporating the nation-building elements of games such as Europa Universalis 2 and a versatile tactical combat engine. While its modular, open-source design allows for a significant degree of customization of the game engine and the story elements by the community, the FreeOrion team is dedicated to the construction of a living, breathing universe in a 'grand campaign' model.

# Tech Names & Descriptions #

LRN_PHYS_BRAIN
The Physical Brain
LRN_PHYS_BRAIN_DESC
The stuctures and their functions in the brain are determined.  The electrochemical and quantum nature of thought and memory are exposed.  With understanding, alteration and augmentation of brain functions becomes possible, and new ideas are spawned at the frontiers of thought, its expression, and its replacement.
LRN_ALGO_ELEGANCE
Algorithmic Elegance
LRN_ALGO_ELEGANCE_DESC
With greater and greater difficulty of data analysis problems, traditional measures of algorithm performance become less useful due to the limitations of irreducible complexity.  At this stage, other measures of algorithm form and function become significant; aesthetically and metaphorically, the elegance of the solution must be optimized.
LRN_GAL_EXPLO
Galactic Exploration
LRN_GAL_EXPLO_DESC
The discovery of interstellar travel via starlanes ushers in a new age of development in societies.  Old paradigms and petty squabbles between minor factions become insignificant when the entire civilization is faced with the limitless potential of the stars... for growth, or destruction.
LRN_TRANSLING_THT
Translinguistic Thought
LRN_TRANSLING_THT_DESC
Lesser minds struggle with, or accept the confines of the language they have learned. Adequate minds reach and feel constrained by the concepts they are given ways to express. Truely great minds break free of the bounds of language, forming and analyzing thoughts that verge on the transcendental. But merely great minds are left isolated and futile, for without language to express thoughts, how can they share their insights?
LRN_PSIONICS
Psionics
LRN_PSIONICS_DESC
Though deep introspection or artificial enhancement, the brain may  develop abilites to directly interact with the universe around it, bypassing the limitations of a physical body.  Powers such as telepathy, empathy, clairvoyance, prescience, psychokinesis and psychoenergetics replace or surpass mundane biological or technological alternatives.  Applications of these powers, including mind control, personality alteration and possesion have profound implications for the relationship between talented and untalted beings.
LRN_ARTIF_MINDS
Artificial Minds
LRN_ARTIF_MINDS_DESC
While traditional computers have nearly unfathomable intelligence and computational abilities, they lack the essential qualities of self-awareness, consciousness or sentience.  With the development of true artificial minds, these qualities may be synthesized, modified and altered.  These investigations open new avenues of research into cognitive sciences and novel metaparadigms.
LRN_XENOARCH
Xenoarchaeology
LRN_XENOARCH_DESC
The contemporary empires, races and single-star civilizations are not the first or only beings to have lived in this galaxy.  Remains, ruins and rumours of the ancients may be found on deserted planets and lifeless asteroids, or drifting in open space.  Finding and decyphering such clues holds great potential to reveal secrets, teach lessons, or give warnings of ancient knowledge.
LRN_GRAVITONICS
Gravitonics
LRN_GRAVITONICS_DESC
Analagous to the "colour charge" of quantum chromodynamics, there are several types of graviton.  With the common attractive-force graviton, the colloqiual "anti-graviton", "right-graviton" and "left-graviton" may be combined to bend and flex the surface of spacetime arbitrarily.  This manipulation is percieved as control of the force of gravity, permitting structures, craft and investigations previously impossible, even theoretically.
LRN_EVERYTHING
Theory of Everything
LRN_EVERYTHING_DESC
Early, naive theories describe subsets of the four fundamental forces of nature: electromagnetism, the strong and weak nuclear nuclear forces, and gravity.  A complete framework expressing all forces as special cases of a single interaction represents a holy grail of science.  This theory describes the earliest moments of the universe, the most distorted depths of a singularity, the tightest windings of hidden dimensions and the final fate of the cosmos.  Yet still, there may "exist" layers of existence beyond what can be observed and described by science...
LRN_FORCE_FIELD
Force-Field Harmonics
LRN_FORCE_FIELD_DESC
Like Fourier analysis of sound, electromagnetism, strong and weak forces may be expressed as harmonic quantum standing-wave superpositions of force-carrier particles.  By selectively amplifying these harmonics, forces may be arbitrarily controlled to shield, attack, contain or support.
LRN_MIND_VOID
Mind of the Void
LRN_MIND_VOID_DESC
We are not alone in the cosmos... but why should the search be so limited?  Many cultures have myths, legends or fervent belief in a higher consciousness.  Whether a loving or malevolent God, or a detatched observer, it is clear that something, perhaps the universe itself on some level, is alive, aware, watching.
LRN_TIME_MECH
Temporal Mechanics
LRN_TIME_MECH_DESC
What are "now", "future" and "past"?  The twin paradox of special relativity, or the theoretical "wormhole" in place of the twins suggest early forms of "time travel".  Direct manipulation of spacetime and temporal flux permit these effects to be harnessed and magnified.  Temporal incursions cannot perceptible alter the past of the universe that we perceive.  Then cay however compress ages or extend moments to arbitrary durations, to uses limited only by the material supplies provided, and our own patience...
LRN_NDIM_SUBSPACE
N-Dimensional Subspace
LRN_NDIM_SUBSPACE_DESC
Early superstring theorists spoke of 10, 11 or 26 dimensional universes, with all but the 4 macrodimensions "curled up" so tightly as to be unseen.  These and other dimensions may now be uncurled and opened, and the very surface of space itself stretched and pierced by shifting matter to or from levels of existance previously hidden below the surface of our limited perception, or creating layers or bubbles where none existed before.
LRN_MATTER_ENERGY
Matter-Energy Conversion
LRN_MATTER_ENERGY_DESC
At appropriate scales and under specific conditions, matter-energy becomes a unified phenomenon.  Applied at larger scales, complete control over the structure of matter and the dynamics of energy becomes possible, as does the interchange between the two.  Transmutation and replication, at limited scales, become possible.   However, despite the enormous rest mass energy equivalence of matter, converting directly to energy for bulk power generation is generally less effective than comparatively simple fusion generation. 
LRN_UNIF_CONC
Unified Consciousness
LRN_UNIF_CONC_DESC
Telepathic communication between individuals or mind-machine interfaces only permit the most basic, trivial and surface exchanges of thought and ideas.  Truely joined minds function as a single consciousness, with the summed faculties and knowledge of its constituent parts, and acting as a new unique entity.  This has great potential, but also significant risk, in that the union may not seek its own destruction, which is necessary for the original minds to be regained.  Alternatively, one of the minds may dominate the other, controlling or destroying the other, rather than forming an equal, harmonious union.
LRN_TRANSCEND
Singularity of Transcendence
LRN_TRANSCEND_DESC
What is godhood?  Is a god concerned with whether it is moral and benevolent or evil and tyrannical?  Does a god treat mortals with care and love, hatred and suffering or detached indifference?  Does a god even remain aware of the infintitely miniscule affairs of the physical universe, or is true godhood of a form beyond description, of which inability to comprehend by mortals applies equally in the other direction?
GRO_PLANET_ECOL
Planetary Ecology
GRO_PLANET_ECOL_DESC
Agriculture and medical science can drastically increase survivability, causing population growth to become hyperexponential, for a time.  Eventually, new limits to growth arise in the carrying capacity of a planet, and the interconnected web of life that supports it.  Understanding natural ecology and its interaction to stresses permits the system to be sustained, and its benefits reaped for generations to come.
GRO_GENETIC_ENG
Genetic Engineering
GRO_GENETIC_ENG_DESC
The palette of genetics is as varied as the forms of life from which it borrows.  Genes may be removed, copied and reinserted into genomes to create transgenic organisms with combinations of traits not existant or possible in nature.  As well, genes may be altered prior to reinsertion, by writing altering the base codes directly, allowing entirely new genes to be created.  Techniques are limited, however, to small modifications of existing genes that are available for study.
GRO_MEDICAL_PATH
Medical Pathology
GRO_MEDICAL_PATH_DESC
Treatment of diseases and injuries requires thorough understanding of their causes.  
GRO_INDUSTY_FARM
Industrial Farming
GRO_INDUSTY_FARM_DESC
Traditional, simple farming methods are sufficient for small, locally self-sufficient populations without significant limits on available space or time.  With greater specialization of more advanced socieites, however, fewer farmers must feed many more workers from much greater distances away, including even interstellar food shipment for fledgling colonies.  Hydroponics, automation, fertilization, pest control and altered illumination growth cycles become necessary.  Successful use of these tools requires understanding of their function, interactions, costs and low-level mechanims.
GRO_ENV_ENCAPSUL
Environmenal Encapsulation
GRO_ENV_ENCAPSUL_DESC
Covered, surrounded and sealed pockets of a particular environment are essential for space travel, colonization of hazardous planets and preservation of natural diversity on heavily industrialized worlds.  Maintaining the desired conditions is not as trivial as it may seem however, as in many cases there is no external source of pure and clean materials or organisms available.  Rather, it is necessary to create a self-sufficient and sustainable environment, often an entire ecology, capable of recycling and reusing its wastes to supply everything it needs and consumes.
GRO_SYMBIOTIC_BIO
Symbotic Biology
GRO_SYMBIOTIC_BIO_DESC
From the first domesticated animals or agricultural plants, societies discover the benefits of symbiotic relationships with other species.  Later, bacteria or natural parasites are often used for medical purposes.  In these early forms, however, the dominant species is (ideally) in complete control of the relationship, with the "farmed" organism existing only to server its owner.  True symbiosis only occurs when both organisms exist and prosper together, each aiding and depending on the other to mutual benefit, the combination greater than the sum of the parts alone.
GRO_GENETIC_MED
Genetic Medicine
GRO_GENETIC_MED_DESC
Traditional Genetic Engineering alters genetic codes and then implements or raises the modified organism.  Similar techniques may be applied to already matured individuals as well.  Goals of these treatments may be cosmetic or enhancing modifications, or corrective, preventative or time-critical medical treatments.  Reducing the delay between alteration and results from generations to months, days or hours has a corresponding increase in the range and power of possible alterations.
GRO_LIFECYCLE_MAN
Lifecycle Manipulation
GRO_LIFECYCLE_MAN_DESC
Most complex organisms have progress through physiological stages during a lifetime, whether distinctly separated by metamorphises, or blurred by continuous slow aging.  In many cases, one or more of these stages are, at least at a given time, more useful and desirable than others.  By delicate control of hormonal or mental mechanisms, it becomes possible to drastically speed or slow each stage, permitting fully developed and functional individuals to be produced in a fraction of the natural timeframe, and for those individuals to remain functional indefinitely, becoming effectively immortal.
GRO_XENO_GENETICS
Xenological Genetics
GRO_XENO_GENETICS_DESC
Early genetics is limited by the available samples of naturally occuring organims on which to base its modifications.  As well, these modifications are restricted within the limits of the physical mechanisms of genetic code storage, alteration and expression in developed individuals.  By investigating the equivalent systems in entirely different ecosystems and organisms, great insights or revalations may be reached, spurring new developments in more familiar genetic systems.
GRO_NANOTECH_MED
Nanotech Medicine
GRO_NANOTECH_MED_DESC
While genetic alteration can repair or undo the effects of harmful or undesired mutations or correct biochemical imbalances, treating major physical trauma and non-genetic congenital defects requires actual physical corretive measures.  Nanotechnology may be used to accomplish these tasks, with two important advantages:  Correction may be done without invasive surguries and associated secondary damage and risks, and treatment reaction time is greatly reduced, as the tools to do the job are always in place and ready to function.
GRO_ORBIT_FARMING
Orbital Farming
GRO_ORBIT_FARMING_DESC
The primary energy source for food production in most societies is solar radiation.  Bound to a planet, farms have very limited access to this energy, due to the comparatively small solid angle subtended by the planet's surface, and surface farming must also compete with other land uses.  By moving food production to orbital installations, continuous access to solar energy is gained, and any undesired spectral filtration by planetary atmospheres is eliminated.  Food production may be increased dramatically.
GRO_INDUSRY_CLONE
Industrial Cloning
GRO_INDUSRY_CLONE_DESC
Primitive manual nuclear transfer cloning techniques are little more than novelties for large organisms.  By applying techniques similar to industrial mass production or biochemical process engineering, it becomes possible to generate dozens, or millions, of full-grown copies of a single genetic blueprint.  Populations may be made to order, tailored to meet the specific needs of society.
GRO_XENO_HYBRIDS
Xenlological Hybridization
GRO_XENO_HYBRIDS_DESC
Regardless of how well understood, or how adeptly improved, a biological system is limited by its inheirent nature.  Structures and basic physiology can only be altered so far within the confines of a single planet's biology.  With understanding of other biologies, however, the disparate systems may be fused, forming an entirely new hybrid biology, with potential abilities and traits greater than those of any of its parts.
GRO_NANO_CYBERNET
Nanotech Cybernetics
GRO_NANO_CYBERNET_DESC
After applying nanotechnology to internally correct defects or injuries, the next step is to augment or replace natural biochemical systems with superior artificial replacements.  Rather than merely regrowing lost limbs or repairing damaged organs, augments are able to quickly grow new ones to suit their needs at any time.  Antiquated biological systems, from muscle tissue and tendons, down to organelles or enzymes may also be replaced, affording greatly increased strength, endurance and flexibility.
GRO_ENERGY_META
Pure-Energy Metabolism
GRO_ENERGY_META_DESC
The ultimate stage of physical development is to transcend the physical altogether.  Without bodies, individuals and society may move, grow and exist freely, unhindered by unecessary physical limitations and inefficient metabolic processes that waste energy supporting homeostasis.
PRO_MICROGRAV_MAN
Microgravity Manufacturing
PRO_MICROGRAV_MAN_DESC
The microgravity of low planetary orbit offers great potential for  novel manufaturing facility designs, equipment and techniques not possible on planet surfaces.  Solids may be held in place with minimal support.  Liquids and gases float freely, shaped only by surface tension, unless otherwise manipulated.  Factory equipment may be arranged optimally in three dimensions.  These conditions permit great increases in efficiency and productivity, if properly exploited.

PRO_ROBOTIC_PROD
Robotic Production
PRO_ROBOTIC_PROD_DESC
Though high level initial design and initial facility setup still require active supervision, the elimination of operators from the actual production process eliminates many bottlenecks.  Robots work continuously, without perpetual demands for greater economic compensation.  Robots have much greater tolerance for hazardous environmental conditions in the factory, and do not require additional habitable space off-site.  Robots perform their assigned tasks flawlessly, or at least as well as they are instructed.
PRO_FUSION_GEN
Fusion Generation
PRO_FUSION_GEN_DESC
Explosive or uncontrolled thermonuclear reactions are comparatively simple to cause at scales ranging from small tactical warheads to supergiant stellar furnaces.  Controllable, stable and practical power generation from the reaction is somewhat more difficult.  The process remains attractive, however, due to the near-limitless supply of fuel and potential for emissions-free operation.
PRO_ASTEROID_MINE
Asteroid Mining

PRO_CORE_MINE
Deep Core Mining
PRO_CORE_MINE_DESC
The pressure and temperatures in terrestrial planet mantles and cores create large quantities of crystal and mineral formations that only appear on upper crust layers due to vulcanism.  The lower atmospheric layers and core materials of gascious planet contain even more exotic materials, in greater concentrations.  Accessing these regions to extract the materials is difficult and treacherous, but eminently rewarding, compared to traditional surface mining activities.
