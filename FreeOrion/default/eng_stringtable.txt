Small Krill Swarm
SM_KRILL_1_DESC
Space Krill are small vaguely insectile organisms that feed on the dust and rocks far from any gravity well.  Individually simple, Krill communicate via coherent light, allowing the swarm to coordinate and calculate trajectories. Though normally not aggressive, their numbers become a hazard for navigation, and block resupply. The high quantity of low-G resources found in an asteroid belt, provide Krill with the perfect conditions to rapidly multiply.

Individually simple, Krill communicate via coherent light, allowing the swarm to coordinate and calculate trajectories. When in large enough numbers they begin to become agressive towards ships. The high quantity of low-G resources found in an asteroid belt, provide Krill with the perfect conditions to rapidly multiply.

SM_KRILL_4
Plauge of Krill
SM_KRILL_4_DESC
Space Krill are small vaguely insectile organisms that feed on the dust and rocks far from any gravity well.  Individually simple, Krill communicate via coherent light, allowing the swarm to coordinate and calculate trajectories. Krill behavior changes radically when a critical population is reached-- somewhere in the 10s of millions. The normally flighty Krill, become aggressive, attacking ships and destroying orbital structures. The high quantity of low-G resources found in an asteroid belt, provide Krill with the perfect conditions to rapidly multiply.

FREEORION_VISION
FreeOrion, an open-source game based on Master of Orion, is a turn-based game of epic space strategy that builds on the classic '4X' model by incorporating the nation-building elements of games such as Europa Universalis 2 and a versatile tactical combat engine. While its modular, open-source design allows for a significant degree of customization of the game engine and the story elements by the community, the FreeOrion team is dedicated to the construction of a living, breathing universe in a 'grand campaign' model.

SP_FIFTYSEVEN
Fifty-seven
SP_FIFTYSEVEN_DESC
'''Math-obsessed sky-serpents, singing planet-wide fractal songs.

++ research
+ no ethos
- slow population growth
- cannot produce minerals or PP

Biology:
Adult Fifty-Seven are between 10 and 20 m long. The main deviation from the tapering serpentine body are the two resonating domes on the forward dorsal side.  Various fins provide fine control.  Entirely blind, they rely on smell, hearing, an exquisitely honed presure sensitivity, and when the need arises bursts of echolocation.  Fifty-Seven are omnivores: eating flocks of small flying creatures with the same relish as the floating phytoplankton.  Since they remain aloft their entire lives and have no manipulator limbs, the Fifty-Seven have no material technology.

Personality:
The Fifty-Seven show little interest in the rest of the galaxy, or indeed in the parts of their planet that they don't use.  The bulk of their attention individually, and culturally is focused on math.  They do seem eager for new mathematical puzzles, so if research problems can be phrased properly...

Homeworld:
High g swamp world with a very dense atmosphere.

Reason for Staying:
The Fifty-Seven are in constant contact with most of the rest of their species, participating in a complex fractal 'song' that may also be a way to test complex mathematical hypotheses and/or some sort of social or artistic expression. Leaving the fractal song is apparently extremely unattractive.'''

SP_GISGUFGTHRIM_DESC

SP_HIDDENGARDENER
Hidden Gardener
SP_HIDDENGARDENER_DESC
'''A sapient fungal network that tends it's plant food from beneath.

+++ Farming
-- produces no other resources

The Hidden Gardener is a massive distributed fungal intelligence lying just beneath the surface. Each individual covers many square kms. It's actions and thoughts are slow.  Various sensory nodes are scattered about by which it can monitor the weather and the growth of its garden.  A Hidden Gardener by means of enzymes, the encapsulation and releases of seeds, and the control of water tends it's garden to produce precisely the rotting plant matter it needs to survive.

Fungal type life-forms seldom have much use for brains of any type, but the Gardener's unusual, and thoughtful approach to providing itself with food provides enough additional energy to make it work.

Their terran homeworld is an eerily park-like place with plants arrainged with unnatural precision, but no other signs of habitation.

The wide ranging, delicate fungi-nets are too large and integrated into the soil to be moved off-planet.  And since the hidden gardeners reproduce by 'splitting' into two consciousnesses when a Gardener grows too wide-ranging to have a decent thought-latency, there are no small, young individuals to take off planet.'''

SP_ABADDONNIANS

SP_ABADDONNIANS_DESC

GAIA_SPECIAL
Gaia

GAIA_SPECIAL_DESC
'''This planet has essentially been transformed into a living organism, allowing it to change and adapt to suit the needs of it's population.

Doubles the planet's target farming, target health and target population.'''

ANCIENT_RUINS_DEPLETED_SPECIAL
Ancient Ruins

ANCIENT_RUINS_DEPLETED_SPECIAL_DESC
This planet holds the ruins of an advanced ancient race, who have been forgotten in the history books, tripling research on the planet and increasing research on Research-focused planets throughout the empire by one twentieth (non-stacking).

ANCIENT_RUINS_SPECIAL
Ancient Ruins

ANCIENT_RUINS_SPECIAL_DESCRIPTION
This planet holds the ruins of an advanced ancient race, who have been forgotten in the history books, tripling research on the planet and increasing research on Research-focused planets throughout the empire by one twentieth (non-stacking).  The first empire with the tech Xenoarchaeological Restoration to possess this planet receives one free ultra-rare tech or uncovers an ultra-rare building or ship.

MINERALS_SPECIAL
Mineral Rich

MINERALS_SPECIAL_DESCRIPTION
'''This planet has a rich natural deposit of minerals, boosting mining significantly.

Increases target mining by 50 when focus is set to Mining, and by twice the planet's population when focus is set to Heavy Mining.'''

TUNNELS_SPECIAL
Natural Tunnels

TUNNELS_SPECIAL_DESCRIPTION
'''This planet has a network of naturally formed tunnels, enabling a much larger portion of the planet to be easily colonized.

Increases the population that can be supported by the planet by 2, 4, 6, 8 or 10 for Tiny, Small, Medium, Large or Huge planets, respectively, and by an additional 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 if the owner has the tech Subterranean Construction.'''

TECHTONIC_INSTABILITY_SPECIAL
Tectonically Unstable

TECHTONIC_INSTABILITY_SPECIAL_DESC
'''This planet is tectonically unstable.  Frequent earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions or unpredictable support below foundations make construction and general infrastructure development difficult.

Resource supply length from this planet is decreased by 1.'''

SOLID_CORE_SPECIAL
Solid Core

SOLID_CORE_SPECIAL_DESC
'''This planet's core has solidified, and it has a very weak magnetic field.  The star's solar wind reaches the surface relatively unfiltered, damaging the health of the planet's population.

Health is reduced by 5.'''

HIGH_AXIAL_TILT_SPECIAL
High Axial Tilt

HIGH_AXIAL_TILT_SPECIAL_DESC
'''This planet's rotational axis is highly tilted relative to its orbital plane.  Seasonal weather variations are particularly extreme and infrastructure development is significantly impeded.

Resource supply length from this planet is decreased by 1.'''

SLOW_ROTATION_SPECIAL
Very Slow Rotation

SLOW_ROTATION_SPECIAL_DESC
'''This planet rotates about its axis very slowly, causing very long days and nights.  Infrastructure growth and food production are reduced.

Resource supply length from this planet is decreased by 1, and target farming is decreased by 10.'''

TIDAL_LOCK_SPECIAL
Tidally Locked Rotation

TIDAL_LOCK_SPECIAL_DESC
'''This planet is tidally locked with the star it orbits.  Its day and year are the same duration, and one half of the planet is perpetually day, the other perpetually night.  Infrastructure growth is hampered, though once established, industrial capacity benefits from the locally stable surface conditions.

Resource supply length from this planet is decreased by 1, but industry is increased by one fifth the planet's population.'''

ECCENTRIC_ORBIT_SPECIAL
Eccentric Orbit

ECCENTRIC_ORBIT_SPECIAL_DESC
'''This planet's orbit is very eccentric.  It has a large distance between its closest and farthest approaches to its star.  Total insolation varies significantly throughout the year.  The varied conditions inhibit infrastructure development, but provide a beneficial platform for research.

Resource supply length from this planet is decreased by 1, but research is increased by 3.'''

RESONANT_MOON_SPECIAL
Resonant Moon

RESONANT_MOON_SPECIAL_DESC
This planet has a natural satellite, the orbital period of which is in 1:1 resonance with its rotational period, causing there to be a "dark side" which is constantly facing away from the planet.  This "dark side" is a perfect site for clandestine facilities.

COMPUTRONIUM_SPECIAL
Computronium Moon
COMPUTRONIUM_SPECIAL_DESC
'''Left by some vanished civilization, the entire moon --from surface to core-- is a computing device of awesome power. It can complete the most complicated simulations and equations faster than they can be entered.  All research-focused planets in the system recieve a large population-based bonus.'''

COMPUTRONIUM_BROKEN_SPECIAL
Damaged Computronium Moon
COMPUTRONIUM_BROKEN_SPECIAL_DESC
'''Left by some vanished civilization, the entire moon --from surface to core-- is a computing device of awesome power. This one however has been blasted by some unknown weapon of war leaving most of the computronium fused and useless.  Still it can complete complicated simulations and equations in impressive time. All research-focused planets in the system recieve a population-based bonus.'''

ABANDONED_COLONY_SPECIAL
Abandoned Colony
ABANDONED_COLONY_SPECIAL
An old abandoned colony.  Some of the infrastructure should still be useful.

# Theory Tech Names & Descriptions #
####################################

THEORY_SHORT_DESC
Theoretical Prerequisite

LRN_PHYS_BRAIN
The Physical Brain

LRN_PHYS_BRAIN_DESC
The structures and their functions in the brain are determined.  The electrochemical and quantum nature of thought and memory are exposed.  With understanding, alteration and augmentation of brain functions becomes possible, and new ideas are spawned at the frontiers of thought, its expression, and its replacement.

LRN_ALGO_ELEGANCE
Algorithmic Elegance

LRN_ALGO_ELEGANCE_DESC
With greater and greater difficulty of data analysis problems, traditional measures of algorithm performance become less useful due to the limitations of irreducible complexity.  At this stage, other measures of algorithm form and function become significant; aesthetically and metaphorically, the elegance of the solution must be optimized.

LRN_TRANSLING_THT
Translinguistics

LRN_TRANSLING_THT_DESC
Lesser minds struggle with, or accept the confines of the language they have learned. Adequate minds reach and feel constrained by the concepts they are given ways to express. Truly great minds break free of the bounds of language, forming and analyzing thoughts that verge on the transcendental. But merely great minds are left isolated and futile, for without language to express thoughts, how can they share their insights?

LRN_PSIONICS
Psionics

LRN_PSIONICS_DESC
Through deep introspection or artificial enhancement, the brain may develop abilities to directly interact with the universe around it, bypassing the limitations of a physical body.  Powers such as telepathy, empathy, clairvoyance, prescience, psychokinesis and psychoenergetics replace or surpass mundane biological or technological alternatives.  Applications of these powers, including mind control, personality alteration and possession have profound implications for the relationship between talented and untalented beings.

LRN_ARTIF_MINDS
Artificial Minds

LRN_ARTIF_MINDS_DESC
While traditional computers have nearly unfathomable intelligence and computational abilities, they lack the essential qualities of self-awareness, consciousness or sentience.  With the development of true artificial minds, these qualities may be synthesized, modified and altered.  These investigations open new avenues of research into cognitive sciences and novel metaparadigms.

LRN_XENOARCH
Xenoarchaeology

LRN_XENOARCH_DESC
The contemporary empires, races and single-star civilizations are not the first or only beings to have lived in this galaxy.  Remains, ruins and rumours of the ancients may be found on deserted planets and lifeless asteroids, or drifting in open space.  Finding and deciphering such clues holds great potential to reveal secrets, teach lessons, or give warnings of ancient knowledge.

LRN_GRAVITONICS
Gravitonics

LRN_GRAVITONICS_DESC
Analogous to the "colour charge" of quantum chromodynamics, there are several types of graviton.  With the common attractive-force graviton, the colloquial "anti-graviton", "right-graviton" and "left-graviton" may be combined to bend and flex the surface of spacetime arbitrarily.  This manipulation is perceived as control of the force of gravity, permitting structures, craft and investigations previously impossible, even theoretically.

LRN_EVERYTHING
Theory of Everything

LRN_EVERYTHING_DESC
Early, naive theories describe subsets of the four fundamental forces of nature: electromagnetism, the strong and weak nuclear forces, and gravity.  A complete framework expressing all forces as special cases of a single interaction represents a holy grail of science.  This theory describes the earliest moments of the universe, the most distorted depths of a singularity, the tightest windings of hidden dimensions and the final fate of the cosmos.  Yet still, there may "exist" layers of existence beyond what can be observed and described by science...

LRN_FORCE_FIELD
Force-Field Harmonics

LRN_FORCE_FIELD_DESC
Like Fourier analysis of sound, electromagnetism, strong and weak forces may be expressed as harmonic quantum standing-wave superpositions of force-carrier particles.  By selectively amplifying these harmonics, forces may be arbitrarily controlled to shield, attack, contain or support.

LRN_MIND_VOID
Mind of the Void

LRN_MIND_VOID_DESC
We are not alone in the cosmos... but why should the search be so limited?  Many cultures have myths, legends or fervent belief in a higher consciousness.  Whether a loving or malevolent God, or a detached observer, it is clear that something, perhaps the universe itself on some level, is alive, aware, watching.

LRN_TIME_MECH
Temporal Mechanics

LRN_TIME_MECH_DESC
What are "now", "future" and "past"?  The twin paradox of special relativity, or the theoretical "wormhole" in its place, suggest early forms of "time travel".  Direct manipulation of spacetime and temporal flux permit these effects to be harnessed and magnified.  Temporal incursions cannot perceptibly alter the past of the universe that we perceive.  They can, however, compress ages or extend moments to arbitrary durations, to uses limited only by the material supplies provided, and our own patience...

LRN_NDIM_SUBSPACE
N-Dimensional Subspace

LRN_NDIM_SUBSPACE_DESC
Early superstring theorists spoke of 10, 11 or 26 dimensional universes, with all but the 4 macrodimensions "curled up" so tightly as to be unseen.  These and other dimensions may now be uncurled and opened, and the very surface of space itself stretched and pierced by shifting matter to or from levels of existence previously hidden below the surface of our limited perception, or creating layers or bubbles where none existed before.

LRN_UNIF_CONC
Unified Consciousness

LRN_UNIF_CONC_DESC
Telepathic communication between individuals or mind-machine interfaces only permit the most basic, trivial and surface exchanges of thought and ideas.  Truly joined minds function as a single consciousness, with the summed faculties and knowledge of its constituent parts, and acting as a new unique entity.  This has great potential, but also significant risk, in that the union may not seek its own destruction, which is necessary for the original minds to be regained.  Alternatively, one of the minds may dominate the other, controlling or destroying the other, rather than forming an equal, harmonious union.

LRN_QUANT_NET
Quantum Networking

LRN_QUANT_NET_DESC
Every particle is inextricably connected on the quantum level to every particle with which it has previously interacted.  Older mechanistic ideas about cause and effect do not apply on this level, and particles can "communicate" instantaneously across vast distances.  When a thorough understanding of this phenomena is acquired, selective small-scale action-at-a-distance between any two points can be achieved instantaneously and outdated relativistic speed limits no longer apply to the transfer of information.

LRN_TRANSCEND
Singularity of Transcendence

LRN_TRANSCEND_DESC
What is godhood?  Is a god concerned with whether it is moral and benevolent or evil and tyrannical?  Does a god treat mortals with care and love, hatred and suffering or detached indifference?  Does a god even remain aware of the infinitely miniscule affairs of the physical universe, or is true godhood of a form beyond description, of which inability to comprehend by mortals applies equally in the other direction?

GRO_MEDICAL_PATH
Medical Pathology

GRO_MEDICAL_PATH_DESC
Treatment of diseases and injuries requires a thorough understanding of their causes.  By studying the subtleties and intricacies of various ailments, it is possible to develop far more effective treatment methods.

GRO_PLANET_ECOL
Planetary Ecology

GRO_PLANET_ECOL_DESC
Agriculture and medical science can drastically increase survivability, allowing great increases in population and food production.  Eventually, new limits to growth arise in the carrying capacity of a planet, and the interconnected web of life that supports it.  Understanding natural ecology and its interaction to stresses permits the system to be modified and enhanced, and its benefits reaped for generations to come.

GRO_GENETIC_ENG
Genetic Engineering

GRO_GENETIC_ENG_DESC
The palette of genetics is as varied as the forms of life from which it borrows.  Genes may be removed, copied and reinserted into genomes to create transgenic organisms with combinations of traits not existent or possible in nature.  As well, genes may be altered prior to reinsertion, by altering the base codes directly, allowing entirely new genes to be created.  Techniques are limited, however, to small modifications of existing genes that are available for study.

GRO_ENV_ENCAPSUL
Environmental Encapsulation

GRO_ENV_ENCAPSUL_DESC
Covered, surrounded and sealed pockets of a particular environment are essential for space travel, colonization of hazardous planets and preservation of natural diversity on heavily industrialized worlds.  Maintaining the desired conditions is not as trivial as it may seem however, as in many cases there is no external source of pure and clean materials or organisms available.  Rather, it is necessary to create a self-sufficient and sustainable environment, often an entire ecology, capable of recycling and reusing its wastes to supply everything it needs and consumes.

GRO_SYMBIOTIC_BIO
Symbiotic Biology

GRO_SYMBIOTIC_BIO_DESC
From the first domesticated animals or agricultural plants, societies discover the benefits of symbiotic relationships with other species.  Later, bacteria or natural parasites are often used for medical purposes.  In these early forms, however, the dominant species is (ideally) in complete control of the relationship, with the "farmed" organism existing only to server its owner.  True symbiosis only occurs when both organisms exist and prosper together, each aiding and depending on the other to mutual benefit, the combination greater than the sum of the parts alone.

GRO_GENETIC_MED
Genetic Medicine

GRO_GENETIC_MED_DESC
Traditional Genetic Engineering alters genetic codes, then grows the modified organism from an embryonic state.  Similar techniques may be applied to already matured individuals.  The goals of these treatments may be cosmetic, functional, corrective, preventative or life-saving medical treatments.  Reducing the delay between alteration and results from generations to months, days or hours has a corresponding increase in the range and power of possible alterations.

GRO_LIFECYCLE_MAN
Lifecycle Manipulation

GRO_LIFECYCLE_MAN_DESC
Most complex organisms progress through various physiological stages during a lifetime, whether distinctly separated by metamorphoses, or blurred by continuous slow aging.  In many cases, one or more of these stages are, at least at a given time, more useful and desirable than others.  By delicate control of hormonal or mental mechanisms, it becomes possible to drastically speed or slow each stage, permitting fully developed and functional individuals to be produced in a fraction of the natural timeframe, and for those individuals to remain functional indefinitely, becoming effectively immortal.

GRO_EDV_ECOMAN
Advanced Ecomanipulation

GRO_EDV_ECOMAN_DESC
Even in an artificial environment, weather patterns and natural ecological cycles can get out of control, causing large amounts of damage.  By introducing stabilizing factors, incidents of destructive ecological forces in artificial environments can be reduced, allowing large-scale environmental modifications.

GRO_XENO_GENETICS
Xenological Genetics

GRO_XENO_GENETICS_DESC
Early genetics is limited by the available samples of naturally occurring organisms on which to base its modifications.  As well, these modifications are restricted within the limits of the physical mechanisms of genetic code storage, alteration and expression in developed individuals.  By investigating the equivalent systems in entirely different ecosystems and organisms, great insights or revelations may be reached, spurring new developments in more familiar genetic systems.

GRO_NANOTECH_MED
Nanotech Medicine

GRO_NANOTECH_MED_DESC
While genetic alteration can repair or undo the effects of harmful or undesired mutations or correct biochemical imbalances, treating major physical trauma and non-genetic congenital defects requires actual physical corrective measures.  Nanotechnology may be used to accomplish these tasks, with two important advantages:  Correction may be done without invasive surgeries and associated secondary damage and risks, and treatment reaction time is greatly reduced, as the tools to do the job are always in place and ready to function.

GRO_ECO_METAMORPH
Ecological Metamorphosis

GRO_ECO_METAMORPH_DESC
Often, it is helpful to think of an ecosystem as a gigantic organism in and of itself, with predator-prey relationships acting as negative feedback loops, with newly introduced species acting as symbiotes or parasites, with populations acting as systems and individuals acting as cells.  In this sense, every planet is alive, and as such, goes through various phases of "life".  By manipulating these phases as one would in a biological organism, it would be possible to affect a planets environment with comparative ease and efficiency.

GRO_XENO_HYBRIDS
Xenological Hybridization

GRO_XENO_HYBRIDS_DESC
Regardless of how well understood, or how adeptly improved, a biological system is limited by its inherent nature.  Structures and basic physiology can only be altered so far within the confines of a single planet's biology.  With understanding of other biologies however, the disparate systems may be fused, forming an entirely new hybrid biology with potential abilities and traits greater than those of any of its parts.

GRO_NANO_CYBERNET
Nanotech Cybernetics

GRO_NANO_CYBERNET_DESC
After applying nanotechnology to internally correct defects or injuries, the next step is to augment or replace natural biochemical systems with superior artificial replacements.  Rather than merely regrowing lost limbs or repairing damaged organs, augments are able to quickly grow new ones to suit their needs at any time.  Antiquated biological systems, from muscle tissue and tendons, down to organelles or enzymes may also be replaced, affording greatly increased strength, endurance and flexibility.

GRO_TRANSORG_SENT
Trans-Organic Sentience

GRO_TRANSORG_SENT_DESC
Sentience as we know it is always observed as being inextricably tied to biological life.  By grasping the true nature and origin of sentience itself, it would be possible to create conscious entities that could not possibly be classified as life as we know it.

GRO_ENERGY_META
Pure-Energy Metabolism

GRO_ENERGY_META_DESC
The ultimate stage of physical development is to transcend the physical altogether.  Without bodies, individuals and society may move, grow and exist freely, unhindered by unnecessary physical limitations and inefficient metabolic processes that waste energy supporting homeostasis.

PRO_MICROGRAV_MAN
Microgravity Manufacturing

PRO_MICROGRAV_MAN_DESC
The microgravity of low planetary orbit offers great potential for novel manufacturing facility designs, equipment and techniques not possible on planet surfaces.  Solids may be held in place with minimal support.  Liquids and gases float freely, shaped only by surface tension, unless otherwise manipulated.  Factory equipment may be arranged optimally in three dimensions.  These conditions permit great increases in efficiency and productivity, if properly exploited.

PRO_PLANET_GEOL
Planetary Geology

PRO_PLANET_GEOL_DESC
Useful minerals are created throughout the volume of a planet, under various exacting chemical and thermodynamic conditions, including aqueous surface sedimentation, crushing core differentiation and mid-depth metamorphosis.  After creation, processes such as plate tectonics, vulcanism and deep convection currents are equally important in determining the final location and form of these extractable resources.  Understanding these processes and their effects, causes and signs is essential for large scale efficient mining operations.

PRO_ROBOTIC_PROD
Robotic Production

PRO_ROBOTIC_PROD_DESC
Although high level initial design and initial facility setup still require active supervision, the elimination of operators from the actual production process eliminates many bottlenecks.  Robots work continuously, without perpetual demands for greater economic compensation.  Robots have much greater tolerance for hazardous environmental conditions in the factory, and do not require additional habitable space off-site.  Robots perform their assigned tasks flawlessly, or at least as well as they are instructed.

PRO_FUSION_GEN
Fusion Generation

PRO_FUSION_GEN_DESC
Explosive or uncontrolled thermonuclear reactions are comparatively simple to cause at scales ranging from small tactical warheads to supergiant stellar furnaces.  Controllable, stable and practical power generation from the reaction is somewhat more difficult.  The process remains attractive, however, due to the near-limitless supply of fuel and potential for emissions-free operation.

PRO_NANOTECH_PROD
Nanotech Production

PRO_NANOTECH_PROD_DESC
Traditional production techniques are fundamentally limited by the size and form of the tools they employ.  As a product takes form, its outer layers may prevent direct access and manipulation of the inner structure, requiring inconvenient and inefficient adjustment to the order of assembly.  Furthermore, the components of a larger product must be carefully formed and assembled to exacting specifications to ensure they will function as intended when combined.  By using nanotechnology to form a complete product in one step, directly from the stock materials, these limitations can be bypassed, dramatically improving efficiency and production speed.

PRO_ORBITAL_GEN
Orbital Generation

PRO_ORBITAL_GEN_DESC
Low orbit of planetary bodies provides numerous benefits for power generation compared to planetary surfaces.  Direct exposure to nearby solar radiation without atmospheric attenuation, and the orders of magnitude larger structures that may be assembled in microgravity to collect it are significant advantages.  The resulting power may be used in orbit, or may be beamed to the planet to support surface industry.  As well, new mechanisms of energy conversion become available in orbit, including planetary magnetic field coupling, orbital momentum exchange, and frictional heating with planetary atmospheres, which are uniquely beneficial for specialized applications.

PRO_SENTIENT_AUTOMATION
Sentient Automation

PRO_SENTIENT_AUTOMATION_DESC
As equipment becomes increasingly automated, it becomes capable of fully replicating and maintaining itself without outside support, other than its required raw materials and a requested, or suggested, final product to produce.  When controlled by an artificial mind, the entire system can learn, plan, react, and adapt autonomously, and can do so without the cumbersome inefficiencies traditionally required to house and employ workers.

PRO_INTSTEL_COPRO
Interstellar Co-Production

PRO_INTSTEL_COPRO_DESC
Traditional means of production are limited by the necessity of self-sufficiency due to transportation and other logistical problems.  Later developments in planetary regional cooperation permit some degree of specialization and co-operation, with each facility producing only a few parts or subsystems, and the whole system benefitting from concentrated expertise and economy of scale.  Expanding this concept several orders of magnitude, it may adapted to a galactic scale, with individual planets or entire systems functioning in the role of the single specialized facility.  The logistical difficulties inherent in this paradigm are also similar to those of the earlier iteration, and are scaled up to the same degree as the potential benefits.

PRO_NDIM_ASSMB
N-Dimensional Assembly

PRO_NDIM_ASSMB_DESC
The geometry of physical space has always been a major impediment to the assembly of objects within that space.  Objects cannot be collocated, and volumes cannot be simultaneously enclosed and open if their existence is restricted to a mere three dimensions.  Moving beyond this limitation, parts of objects can be folded out of the way in a pocket dimensions, and continguous lines may be passed around other masses by going "off-axis".  Similar mechanisms are also used to assemble lower-dimensional objects in configurations that would be impossible without higher-dimensional pathways.

PRO_SINGULAR_GEN
Singularity Generation

PRO_SINGULAR_GEN_DESC
As matter is drawn towards a singularity by the intense spacetime curvature, or gravitational field, the matter forms an accretion disk and is greatly compressed and heated.  High energy radiation emitted from the disk may be captured and harnessed for power generation.  The event horizon of the singularity itself also emits radiation due to the annihilation of virtual particle-antiparticle pairs that form in its vicinity.  This method of power generation is significantly more delicate and unstable than the accretion disk method, but can produce an even greater output.

PRO_ENERGY_CONV
Energy Conversion

PRO_ENERGY_CONV_DESC
At appropriate scales and under specific conditions, matter-energy becomes a unified phenomenon.  Applied at larger scales, complete control over the structure of matter and the dynamics of energy becomes possible, as does the interchange between the two.  Transmutation and replication, at limited scales, become possible.   However, despite the enormous rest mass energy equivalence of matter, converting directly to energy for bulk power generation is generally less effective than comparatively simple fusion generation.

PRO_ZERO_GEN
Zero-Point Generation

PRO_ZERO_GEN_DESC
Any power generation mechanism that involves a material fuel supply is limited by the relativistic mass-energy relationship: no more energy can be produced than equivalent mass consumed, even with perfect efficiency.  By tapping the inherent energy of the vacuum, or zero-point energy, an effectively infinite source is made available.  The rate, or power, of this extraction is also theoretically unbounded, with limits only in the available means to collect and use the output.

PRO_NEUTRONIUM_EXTRACTION
Neutronium Extraction

PRO_NEUTRONIUM_EXTRACTION_DESC
The core of a neutron star consists of degenerate neutron matter, compressed by gravity to a density far greater than the heaviest normal matter.  This exotic material has numerous applications once extracted from the star, allowing production of otherwise impossible structures and ship parts.

CON_ARCH_PSYCH
Architectural Psychology

CON_ARCH_PSYCH_DESC
The form of a structure or inhabited space is not merely guided by the physical limitations of the materials from which it is constructed.  Psychological effects on the inhabitants within, or observers outside can have a far greater influence on the success of a design than the strength of a wall or sturdiness of a foundation.

CON_INFRA_ECOL
Infrastructure Ecology

CON_INFRA_ECOL_DESC
The basic infrastructure of an established planetary colony may seem to be created entirely by the colonizers, and to function only according to their designs.  In reality, however, the ecology of the planet on which it is built is the foundation and support mechanism for the added infrastructure, and often forms an integral part of its function.  Understanding the interaction between natural and artificial components, and the limits of the resources an ecological system can provide are essential to the development of an optimal and sustainable infrastructure for any colony.

CON_ORGANIC_STRC
Organic Structures

CON_ORGANIC_STRC_DESC
Buildings formed of inanimate minerals are functional and occasionally elegant, and those of harvested but dead organics are often simple and inexpensive.  Actual living structures, however, can be grown into their final shape with no additional labour, as well effect some degree of self-repair when damaged.  They may also naturally self-regulate their internal environments, or potentially adapt to varied or changing surroundings as necessary, during or after their initial growth.

CON_METRO_INFRA
Metroplex Infrastructure

CON_METRO_INFRA_DESC
When the entire surface of a world is covered, continued development must occur above and below pre-existing construction.   Care must be taken to ensure the stability of the undercut or overshadowed structures are not damaged, and transportation and supply routes must be rethought to support vastly increased population densities.  Furthermore, novel stylistic and functional issues must be considered, to ensure that the newer levels, and the combined whole, are worth inhabiting.

CON_ARCH_MONOFILS
Architectural Monofilaments

CON_ARCH_MONOFILS_DESC
Essentially unbreakable and merely a few atoms in diameter, single-crystal filaments have many uses in improving traditional structure designs in durability and economy of construction.  The capacity to suspend or stress other materials in previously impossible configurations also permits a wholly new designs.  Low weight and high strength filaments are of particular use in large-scale orbital or surface to orbit spanning structures, where variations in gravity across lengths were previously very prohibitive.

CON_ASYMP_MATS
Asymptotic Materials

CON_ASYMP_MATS_DESC
Once certain thresholds of performance are passed, measuring the physical properties of materials for relative comparison becomes impractical in any terms other than orders of magnitude or logarithmic scales.  Much like superconductivity in electronics, the tensile strength, toughness, density, elasticity, refractory index and other mechanical properties of materials may be controlled with effectively no limits.  With all previously significant limitations removed, structure designs are further unhindered, and may extend or change by similar order of magnitude scales.

CON_FRC_ENRG_STRC
Force-Energy Structures

CON_FRC_ENRG_STRC_DESC
When forces and energy can be manipulated as desired to provide the same functionality as solid surfaces, there is no essential need to have physical materials enclosing the occupants of a building.  Structures composed entirely of energy have many advantages, including simple reconfiguration, resilience, portability and novel design possibilities.

CON_CONTGRAV_ARCH
Controlled Gravity Architecture

CON_CONTGRAV_ARCH_DESC
By fully controlling the orientation and strength of gravitational forces acting upon and existent within a structure, designs may simultaneously exhibit the freedom of weightlessness and the utility of having a defined up and down.  The structure itself, and the local environments it seeks to provide, may take any shape in space, extending to great lengths, looping about itself, and making arbitrary interconnections.  Simultaneously, local environments within may be infused with a useful tug, which may vary from or be entirely different from immediately adjacent areas.  Such versatility permits great new functional designs for social, manufacturing or other uses.

CON_GAL_INFRA
Galactic Infrastructure

CON_GAL_INFRA_DESC
Integration and development of the infrastructures on highly productive worlds into a unified galaxy-spanning network is one of the greatest logistical effort conceivable.  When completed, such a system functionally unifies the worlds of which it is composed.  Integrated transportation, housing, maintenance, and construction tools may be fluidly deployed wherever needed to optimally alter resource allocations or adjust to changes.

CON_ART_HEAVENLY
Artificial Heavenly Bodies

CON_ART_HEAVENLY_DESC
When roughly the mass of a small moon or larger, it is no longer sufficient to conceive of what is wrought as a "structure", "station" or "ship".  Rather, beyond this scale, the object becomes more like a heavenly body; its gravitational pull influences orbital motions, it may retain an thin atmosphere on its surface, and it may be orbited by, rather than orbiting with, lesser structures.  At even larger scales, entire planets may be built, or rebuilt, or even new stars may be formed and ignited, broadcasting the power and determination of their creators throughout the universe.

CON_TRANS_ARCH
Transcendent Architecture

CON_TRANS_ARCH_DESC
The epitome of design unifies optimal functionality with elegance of form.  A transcendent structure expands and inspires the minds of its occupants or observers with its shape, placement, substance and integration, whether through awe-inspiring scale, perfect emphasis of a single idea, perception or lack thereof, or utter simplicity and fitness for purpose.

CON_NDIM_STRC
N-Dimensional Structures

CON_NDIM_STRC_DESC
Of all the bizarre feats of applied physics, the ability to to fold space onto itself has the most direct and profound influence on structural form and design.  The potential is endless, literally as hallways are made to bend back upon their beginning, or given a twist so that their ceiling becomes their floor.  As well, the concept of urban sprawl becomes laughable, as any number of people may fit into an arbitrarily small volume, safely tucked into an adjacent plane of existence.

SHP_GAL_EXPLO
Galactic Exploration

SHP_GAL_EXPLO_DESC
The discovery of interstellar travel via starlanes ushers in a new era of development of society.  Old political squabbles between minor factions become insignificant when the entire civilization is faced with the limitless potential of the stars... for growth and prosperity, or utter destruction.

SHP_SPACE_TACTICS
Space Tactics

SHP_SPACE_TACTICS_DESC
Battles in microgravity and vacuum require specialized weapon and defensive systems, as well as the theoretical tactics that motivate their use.

SHP_SPACE_WEAPON
Space Weaponry

SHP_SPACE_WEAPON_DESC
Basic land-oriented weaponry can be adapted for use in space and utilized quite effectively.  These weapons cannot however, be as effective as weaponry designed specifically for use in space, with the paradigm of space combat completely dominant over that of ground combat in the minds of the designers.

SHP_MAX_DISRUPT
Maximized Disruption

SHP_MAX_DISRUPT_DESC
The ideas of engineering and construction are very different in the environment of space.  Different structural forms are utilized, and the basic architectural principals are drastically affected by the lack of gravity.  By applying these ideas to the development of weaponry, it is possible to create weapons which are highly effective against microgravity architecture.

SHP_TACT_COUNTER
Tactical Countermeasures

SHP_TACT_COUNTER_DESC
Due to the unfamiliarity of space combat, not all tactical events and possibilities have been thought out and their consequences analyzed.  As such, there may be certain tactics against which a tactically underdeveloped empire would have very little defense.  Theoretical countermeasures to these tactics motivate the development of more advanced defensive systems and special devices.

SHP_TACT_SUPER
Tactical Superiority

SHP_TACT_SUPER_DESC
Many tactical scenarios are a complex form of Rock-Paper-Scissors; a defender may find himself vulnerable to attack because he prepared for a different sort of assault than that with which he was faced.  Likewise, an attacker may have received incorrect or inaccurate information about an opponents defences and find that his method of attack is ineffective.  By developing an ideal fighting force for nearly all scenarios, the risk of loss due to unforeseen circumstances can be greatly reduced.

SHP_SURGICAL_DESTRUCT
Surgical Destruction

SHP_SURGICAL_DESTRUCT_DESC
Often, there are highly valuable strategic and tactical targets in a battle which are of far more importance than any other ship engaged in battle, and in some circumstances, every other ship engaged in battle.  Maximizing the effectiveness with which a single valuable target can be identified and destroyed can be of great strategic value.

SHP_STRAT_DEFENSE
Strategic Defense

SHP_STRAT_DEFENSE_DESC
When the protection of a strategic target is the primary or only concern in a battle, any cost in either production of defensive material or casualties is acceptable.  With proper equipment and tactics, a strategic target can be made significantly more difficult to destroy.

SHP_NAVIGATION
Interstellar Navigation

SHP_NAVIGATION_DESC
Starlanes form a relatively restrictive network of possible paths, but interstellar travel is complicated and risky without proper navigation techniques, as well as proper defensive equipment.

SHP_INTSTEL_LOG
Interstellar Logistics

SHP_INTSTEL_LOG_DESC
Effectively supplying ships, ordering general fleet movement and even organizing the movement of specific ships in battle requires a complex understanding of navigation and detection, and of methods of information acquisition.

SHP_ADV_NAVIGATION
Advanced Navigation

SHP_ADV_NAVIGATION_DESC
The dangers of the untampered universe are miniscule compared to the dangers of a universe fraught with other ships, both friend and foe.  By integrated the known effects of other empires on the conditions of starlanes and interplanetary space, more effective navigation methods can be enacted.

SHP_NEUTRONIUM_ARM
Neutronium Armour

SHP_NEUTRONIUM_ARM_DESC
Neutronium is one of the densest substances in the universe, naturally occurring or otherwise.  As such, it is extremely difficult even break it into manageable pieces for transport.  Through advanced metallurgical processes however, Neutronium can theoretically be plated on to many military vessels.

SHP_MIL_ROBO_CONT
Military Robotic Control

SHP_MIL_ROBO_CONT_DESC
Robotic control can be used effectively for tasks such as farming, mining and industry; the natural extension of this concept is to develop military robotic equipment capable of independently operating a starship.  This would allow greater versatility in design, as the necessity for bulky life-support systems would be removed.  Hulls produced with such technology could also perform dangerous repairs without thought for the safety and biological limitations of living engineers.

SHP_SPACE_FLUX_DRIVE
Spatial Flux Drive

SHP_SPACE_FLUX_DRIVE_DESC
Ordinarily, propulsion in space is limited to either propellant or field propulsion.  On relatively small scales however, it is possible to propel an object in space much like one could in water: by pushing backwards the medium in which the object is immersed.  This requires the manipulation of space itself whereby the smallest units of space are collapsed, forcing the matter they once contained into adjacent units of space.  This method of propulsion is very efficient, but dangerous on larger scales and easily detectable due to the dimensional effects.

SHP_CONTGRAV_MAINT
Contra-Gravitational Maintenence

SHP_CONTGRAV_MAINT_DESC
When the mass of the ship surpasses a certain threshold, it becomes necessary to consider the gravitational stresses on vital architectural points in the ship's structure.  These points will be unable to withstand the gravitational stresses and collapse, destroying the vessel.  This necessitates nearly constant maintenance of these points to avoid total structural failure.

SHP_NANOROBO_MAINT
Nano-Robotic Maintenance

SHP_NANOROBO_MAINT_DESC
Just as nanorobots can be used for production, so also can they be used for maintenance.  A hull with a complement of centrally organized nanite engineers would be able to rapidly repair damage, even during combat.  Such machines would have great difficulty distinguishing organic beings from a part of the hull in need of repair however, and as such this concept could only be applied to automated hulls.

SHP_MASSPROP_SPEC
Mass-Propulsion Specialization

SHP_MASSPROP_SPEC_DESC
Traditional propulsion devices operate well on objects of relatively low mass.  However, when the mass of a ship approaches that of a small moon, ordinary methods of propulsion are very clumsy and require tremendous amounts of energy.  A new approach to propulsion, taking into account the size of the object in question as a fundamental aspect of the system, could allow such vessels to have useful mobility.

SHP_TRANSSPACE_DRIVE
Trans-Spatial Drive

SHP_TRANSSPACE_DRIVE_DESC
Even when spatial dimensions are skewed by relativistic effects, an object generally has constant space-time characteristics.  By creating a device which alters the characteristics of space-time itself using quasi-relativistic effects, it would be possible to create a fast, stealthy method of propulsion. 

SHP_MIDCOMB_LOG
Mid-Combat Logistics

SHP_MIDCOMB_LOG_DESC
When interstellar fleets are in regular, commonplace use, the transfer of personnel and materiel in the absence of enemy ships is a relatively trivial task.  In combat however, when such transfers could potentially have great tactical merit, there is great difficulty with the coordinational aspects of logistics due to the possibility of sudden changes in the tactical scenario.  By using a single mobile command station, it is possible to organize and enact logistic patterns in the midst of combat.

SHP_ASTEROID_HULLS
Asteroid Hulls

SHP_ASTEROID_HULLS_DESC
Rather than constructing a hull from scratch, it is far easier to take a pre-existing space-borne object and adapt it to fill the role of a ship's hull.  Not only would such ships be very inexpensive to produce, but they would also be able to avoid detection by enemy ships by hiding amongst other asteroids.

SHP_ASTEROID_REFORM
Asteroid Reformation

SHP_ASTEROID_REFORM_DESC
While modifying asteroids to serve as ship's hulls is very efficient, it is limited by the available sizes and shapes of available asteroids.  By combining or breaking apart asteroids, asteroid hulls of extremely large or small sizes could be produced.

SHP_MONOMOLEC_LATTICE
Monomolecular Latticing

SHP_MONOMOLEC_LATTICE_DESC
Asteroid Hulls can be reinforced and armour plated, but the fact remains that the basic substance of which most asteroids are primarily composed is of lesser strength than most modern alloys.  However, if the molecular structure of the rock itself were to be rearranged into a crystal lattice, its strength could be increased tremendously, allowing the production of asteroid hulls of previously impossible strengths.

SHP_MULTICELL_CAST
Multi-Cellular Casting

SHP_MULTICELL_CAST_DESC
Even when it is inert, organic material is much more versatile than standard materials.  A non-living multi-cellular ship would provide some of the advantages of organic materials without the customary nuisances of organic life.

SHP_HAB_MEGAFAUN
Habitable Mega-Fauna

SHP_HAB_MEGAFAUN_DESC
It is generally uncommon to find comfortable living conditions within a gigantic space monster.  This is exactly what must exist within an organic hull however, if it is to be adequately controlled from within.  The development of massive, habitable creatures opens up numerous possibilities for ship design.

SHP_MONOCELL_EXP
Mono-Cellular Expansion

SHP_MONOCELL_EXP_DESC
Multi-cellular organisms tend to have longer life spans than single celled organisms due to specialization and interdependency.  However, with the appropriate technological refinements, these aspects of multi-cellular life can be applied to a massive mono-cellular organism, allowing it to have practical functionality in combat.

SHP_CONT_SYMB
Contrived Symbiosis

SHP_CONT_SYMB_DESC
Any ship's hull is in a symbiotic relationship with its makers in that they bring it into being and sustain it, and it performs its desired functions.  However, this is a purely behavioural type of symbiosis.  Through careful planning and design, an organic ship can be made to have a biological symbiotic relationship with its crew, each providing the other with the essentials of life.

SHP_CONT_BIOADAPT
Controlled Bioadaption

SHP_CONT_BIOADAPT_DESC
It is very difficult to predict the actions of a living being to any useful degree of certainty without having an intimate understanding of its behavioural patterns.  By placing a life form under harshly competitive developmental conditions, its behavioural patterns can be manipulated, strengthened and effectively utilized in war.

SHP_BIONEUR_SPEC
Bio-Neural Specialization

SHP_BIONEUR_SPEC_DESC
As a species evolves mental capabilities, the individuals whose minds are not perfectly attuned to the needs of their bodies cannot compete with those whose minds are perfectly specialized for their bodies.  Thus, all evolved life forms have nearly ideal mental development for their type of body.  There are no such guarantees for artificial life forms however, and often the true potential of such a being is unrealized due to subtle incompatibilities between mind and body.  By specializing the organism's neural patterns to conform to its body type, these incompatibilities can be eliminated.

SHP_FRC_ENRG_COMP
Force-Energy Compression

SHP_FRC_ENRG_COMP_DESC
Typically, the manipulation of energy requires it to be in the form of matter so that potential energy can be stored as desired and released on demand.  Matter converted to pure energy stored in the fabric of space-time itself would be more versatile than any material substance, but impossible to contain without advanced force-field technology.

SHP_QUANT_ENRG_MAG
Quantum Energy Magnification

SHP_QUANT_ENRG_MAG_DESC
Due to quantum uncertainty, it is possible for a particle to arbitrarily gain a small amount of energy or for new particles to temporarily enter existence.  By detecting and magnifying these fluctuations in quantum energy, it would be possible to tremendously increase the capabilities of an energy hull.

SHP_ENRG_BOUND_MAN
Energy Boundary Manipulation

SHP_ENRG_BOUND_MAN_DESC
Whether constructed, grown, or adapted from a pre-existing structure, ships composed of matter must have a logical and co-ordinated structure to allow even basic utility.  Pure energy however, has no such restrictions.  This allows a pure energy hull to take on any form whatsoever, however impractical it would be from a material standpoint.

SHP_SOLAR_CONT
Solar Containment

SHP_SOLAR_CONT_DESC
A hull constructed from pure energy, while far more versatile than a solid hull, has a disadvantage in that it is unable to harness the potential energy of material objects.  If, however, it were made possible to contain a hull composed not of pure energy, but of super-heated gases constantly undergoing a self-sustaining fusion reaction, the limitations of both pure energy and solid matter could be avoided.

CON_ORBITAL_CON
Orbital Construction

CON_ORBITAL_CON_DESC
'''On a planet, there is always a fixed reference direction: "up".  Microgravity is effectively isotropic.  This single difference has a multitude of consequences for the types of structures that can be built, and which of those forms is the optimal use of space, materials and energy in each environment.  As well, the interior configuration of spaces in orbit must be rethought.  However, while it is appealing to attempt to completely revolutionize interior design in a paradigm completely independent of the styles used on planet surfaces, the practical use of these spaces will be initial primarily by those who are used to, and adapted for, those planet surfaces.  Rather than a complete break from older styles, a gradual transition may be more effective.

Increases the resource supply range of all colonies by 1.'''

CON_SUBTER_CONST
Subterranean Construction

CON_SUBTER_CONST_DESC
'''When space is at a premium, the ability to build downwards as well as up is an invaluable asset.  Entire underground cities and facilities can be constructed and maintained, and trans-planetary subterranean transportation routes can be established.

Increases the population that can be sustained by Good planets by 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 on Tiny, Small, Medium, Large and Huge planets, respectively.'''

CON_SPACE_ELEVATOR
Space Elevator

CON_SPACE_ELEVATOR_DESC
Nano-construction enables production of tensile cables strong enough to reach beyond geostationary orbit.  Shuttles magnetically lifted up the cable are superior to the expensive, inefficient, and highly dangerous rocket launches to escape velocity.

CON_CONC_CAMP
Concentration Camps

CON_CONC_CAMP_DESC
Typically, when forced to work to death, citizens will put up some resistance and have the sympathy and support of outside observers.  However, by carefully creating buildings designed to quench the fire of justice within outsiders, and to promote feelings of worthlessness and subservience in those on the inside, concentration camps can be effectively utilized without fear of revolt.

CON_FRC_ENRG_INFRA
Force-Energy Infrastructure

CON_FRC_ENRG_INFRA_DESC
'''The flexibility and versatility of force-energy structures permits a colonies buildings to be more easily re-tooled to suit new purposes, increasing the rate at which focus changes can take effect.

Increases the growth of resource meters below target value to 3 per turn, and the decay of resource meters above target value to 5 per turn.'''

CON_FRC_ENRG_CAMO
Force-Energy Camouflage

CON_FRC_ENRG_CAMO_DESC
'''Ordinary physical structures tend to be both opaque and rigid, being constructed from similarly opaque and rigid natural materials.  A force field does not, of necessity, possess these features in any permanent sense, and can be turned on and off or changed from one colour to another at will.  While most buildings are easily visible from many uus away with a powerful detection apparatus, a force-energy structure - or a regular structure surrounded by a series of camouflage force-fields - would be essentially invisible from great distances.

Increases the stealth of all buildings by 20.'''

CON_TRANSDIM_HOUSE
Transdimensional Housing

CON_TRANSDIM_HOUSE_DESC
'''The primary limiting factors on a planets population capacity are environmental desirability and space.  By phasing basic infrastructure development into multiple dimensions, spatial limitations are all but eliminated, and under ideal environmental conditions, the maximum population of a planet can be greatly increased.

Increases the population that can be sustained by Good worlds by 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 for Tiny, Small, Medium, Large and Huge planets, respectively.'''

CON_PLANET_DRIVE
Planetary Starlane Drive

CON_PLANET_DRIVE_DESC
Planets in the outermost systems of an empire are often in great danger of attack from enemy fleets, yet these planets can often contain extremely valuable resources and specials.  By equipping an entire planet with the means to open and navigate a starlane, it would be possible to move such planets to a safer location in times of necessity.

CON_GAL_RESOURCE_MAN
Galactic Resource Management

CON_GAL_RESOURCE_MAN_DESC
'''The consistent and effective transportation of resources over large interstellar distances requires laborious planning, and is complicated by numerous factors such as the presence of space monsters, enemy empires and dangerous interstellar phenomena.  By utilizing integrated galactic infrastructure, the fluid deployment of resources between advanced and developing colonies can be achieved, and solutions can be found to particularly troubling logistical problems.

Increases the resource supply range of all colonies by 1.'''

CON_STARGATE
Stargate

CON_STARGATE_DESC
Particularly in more expansive empires, the need to move ships to a specific defensive location in great haste often exceeds the feasibility.  By creating a warp between two or more points in space-time, it can be made possible to move ships even across an entire empire at need, allowing new offensive and defensive strategies.

CON_MEGALITH
Megalith Construction

CON_MEGALITH_DESC
Mastering advanced orbital construction techniques, scientists create methods to enable construction of the awe inspiring Megalith.

CON_GRAVITY_WELLS
Controlled gravity wells

CON_GRAVITY_WELLS_DESC
'''By installing a massive null gravity generator at a planet's core, it becomes possible to turn a planet's gravity on or off like a light switch, but in a narrow well. The planet's industry then gains all the benefits of low-G and zero-G, but without the drawbacks. Reverse gravity wells can also be created, making space launches cost practically nothing.

Increases the resource supply range of all colonies by 1.'''

CON_ART_PLANET
Artificial Planet

CON_ART_PLANET_DESC
Gas giants and asteroid belts offer unique opportunities and resources, not only as sites for acquiring valuable - and on occasion extremely rare - resources, but as raw materials in and of themselves for the production of artificial planets.  Such planets would offer new centres for production in previously empty or entirely occupied systems.  In addition, various key features of the planet can be modified or added during the construction process, potentially allowing the planets size and environment to be specified, or certain planet specials to be added.

CON_ART_MOON
Artificial Moon

CON_ART_MOON_DESC
Though natural satellites are relatively commonplace occurrences amongst planetary bodies, it is truly rare to find a moon with an orbital period equal to that of its rotational period.  Such a satellite would have one side constantly facing away from the planet, allowing the construction of massive installations - which under normal circumstances would be easily visible from the planet's surface - to be constructed with total secrecy, completely invisible to the unsuspecting populace on the planet below.

CON_TRANS_STRC
Transforming Structures

CON_TRANS_STRC_DESC
A shutter functions as both a solid wall and open window, according to the desire of its user.  A room may be refurnished to serve an entirely new purpose, within the limits of the space available.  This concept may also be extended to the actual form and structure of an entire building or city, whether mechanical or organic.  Eliminating the need for demolition and rebuilding permits much greater infrastructure flexibility and efficiency.  Single or isolated structures may also serve many purposes simultaneously, that would previously have required much larger and elaborate fixed designs.

CON_PALACE_EXCLUDE
Palace Excluder

CON_PALACE_EXCLUDE_DESC
Ensures that only one imperial palace will be present in an empire at a time.  Make sure you scrap your old imperial palace before your new one is built.

GRO_SUBSPEC_TREAT
Subspecialized Treatment

GRO_SUBSPEC_TREAT_DESC
'''Many diseases and injuries, or manifestations of the same disease or injury, can have very similar causes and symptoms, but very different ideal treatments.  By treating each individual's illness according its specific manifestation rather than its general categorization, a general benefit to health can be obtained.

Increases health on all planets by 5.'''

GRO_INDUSTRY_FARM
Industrial Farming

GRO_INDUSTRY_FARM_DESC
Traditional, simple farming methods are sufficient for small, locally self-sufficient populations without significant limits on available space or time.  With greater specialization of more advanced societies however, fewer farmers must feed many more workers from much greater distances away, including even interstellar food shipment for fledgling colonies or major industrial centres.  This dependency on interstellar shipping routes makes industrial worlds extremely vulnerable to blockade by enemy forces.  By gradually adapting factories and adding supplementary infrastructure over a long period of time, waste matter and energy can be used to grow food with no extra cost, allowing industrial planets a small supply of food in great need.

GRO_SELF_ROTATING_CROPS
Self-Rotating Crops

GRO_SELF_ROTATING_CROPS_DESC
'''High-intensity farming output benefits from a thorough understanding of the environment and application of this knowledge in custom-tailoring crops via genetic modification.  Self-rotating crops may be grown continually, without the traditional need to alternate to soil rejuvenating - but less productive - plants every few growing seasons.

Increases target farming on Good planets with the Farming focus by the planet's population, and on Adequate planets with the Farming focus by one half of the planet's population.'''

GRO_HABITATION_DOMES
Habitation Domes

GRO_HABITATION_DOMES_DESC
'''While terraforming efforts can make planets much more useful, the process is expensive and time consuming.  Habitation Domes provide a fast, cheap alternative for claiming inhospitable territory, but allow only minimal levels of infrastructure and resource capacity to be developed.

Allows one tenth of a population unit to settle on any previously uninhabitable planet type, including Asteroids and Gas Giants.  Many building types cannot be constructed on these outposts.'''

GRO_SYMBIO_COHAB
Symbiotic Cohabitation

GRO_SYMBIO_COHAB_DESC
'''Members of different species are often in competition with one another for food and habitat.  Predator prey relationships are common, and it can be difficult for sentient beings to remove themselves entirely from competition with other organisms.  By impacting a planet in such a way as to benefit the native flora and fauna and in turn take advantage of their effects, it is possible to eliminate the antagonism between sentient and non-sentient life.

Increases the population that can be sustained by Adequate planets to 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 for Tiny, Small, Medium, Large and Huge planets, respectively.'''

GRO_GENOME_BANK
Genome Bank

GRO_GENOME_BANK_DESC
The unknown variables in genomic calculations for any given species remain severe for all but the simplest genetic repairs, not to mention the changes that a genetic modification can potentially have on a larger multi-species biosphere. To truly realize the benefits of genetic medicine, it is necessary to collect a massive genome database for all the species from all known worlds.

GRO_INDUSTRY_CLONE
Industrial Cloning

GRO_INDUSTRY_CLONE_DESC
Primitive manual nuclear transfer cloning techniques are little more than novelties for large organisms.  By applying techniques similar to industrial mass production or biochemical process engineering, it becomes possible to generate dozens, or millions, of full-grown copies of a single genetic blueprint.  Populations may be made to order, tailored to meet the specific needs of society.

GRO_SUSPENDED_ANIMATION
Suspended Animation

GRO_SUSPENDED_ANIMATION_DESC
Through chemical manipulation and cryonics, life processes may be halted without terminating them permanently.  Beings in this state are preserved indefinitely, consume no resources and require very little storage - not living - space.  With this technique, the capacity of colony ships can be greatly increased.

GRO_ORBIT_FARMING
Orbital Farming

GRO_ORBIT_FARMING_DESC
'''The primary energy source for food production in most societies is solar radiation.  Bound to a planet, farms have very limited access to this energy, due to the comparatively small solid angle subtended by the planet's surface and other land uses competing with surface farming.  By moving food production to orbital installations, continuous access to solar energy is gained, and any undesired spectral filtration by planetary atmospheres is eliminated.

Increases target farming on all planets by 2, regardless of focus and environment.'''

GRO_TERRAFORM
Terraforming

GRO_TERRAFORM_DESC
Changing the environmental type of a planet is a massive undertaking, the challenge of this process is to a large degree logistical.  The precise method depends greatly on the type of planet to be changed and the desired result.  However, in all cases much of the surface of the entire planet and it's atmosphere needs to be converted to other types of molecules, vented into space or buried under the crust.  As such, this process requires most of the planet to be accessible to the terraformers, and cannot be performed on a world with max population less than one.

GRO_TERRAFORM_SHORT_DESC
Allows terraforming

GRO_XENOGEN_ADAPT
Xenogenetic Adaptation

GRO_XENOGEN_ADAPT_DESC
'''The study of other life forms often exemplifies the weaknesses inherent in  one's own species.  By studying other life forms and using that knowledge to improve upon one's own genetic code, it is possible to develop many useful adaptations that would be otherwise impossible.

Increases the population that can be sustained by Poor planets to 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, and the population that can be sustained by Adequate planets to 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 for Tiny, Small, Medium, Large and Huge planets, respectively.  Health on Poor and Adequate planets is increased by 5.'''

GRO_ENDOPHIL_NANOMED
Endophiliac Nanomedication

GRO_ENDOPHIL_NANOMED_DESC
'''Pathogens, particularly prokaryotes, are vulnerable to disruption of their genetic material from within - that is, if it is possible to permeate the cell membrane or the protein coating, in the case of viral infections.  By designing nanorobots capable of identifying and penetrating such pathogens, it would be possible to destroy them by completely deconstructing their genetic material.

Increases health on all planets by 10.'''

GRO_REMOTE_TERRAFORM
Remote Terraforming

GRO_REMOTE_TERRAFORM_DESC
Traditional terraforming methods treat the planet as a structure and attempt to alter its environment through physical and chemical means.  This necessitates that the majority of the planet be accessible to the terraforming species, which generally limits its usefulness.  By treating the planet as an organism and altering it's physiology indirectly, it is possible to make use of less labour intensive, though more time consuming terraforming methods, allowing outposts on poor and hostile worlds to make use of terraforming.

GRO_XENO_SYMBIOGEN
Xenological Symbiogenesis

GRO_XENO_SYMBIOGEN_DESC
'''Often, the native fauna of a planet are far better suited to a planet's environment than any colonists who would try to inhabit it.  These adverse effects can include anything from weather patterns to the planet's size.  Through xenological hybridization, a genetically adapted form of the colonizing species can be developed with the advantageous traits of the native fauna, thus allowing more of the planet to be inhabited.

Increases the population that can be sustained by Hostile planets to 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, by Poor planets to 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20, and by Adequate planets to 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 for Tiny, Small, Medium, Large and Huge planets, respectively.  Health on Hostile, Poor and Adequate planets is increased by 5.'''

GRO_BIOTERROR
Bioterror Facilites

GRO_BIOTERROR_DESC
A research centre created to safely develop the most dangerous of biological weaponry while keeping prying eyes out. Biological weaponry takes effect too slowly to be of much use in a direct military conflict, but as a weapon of terror it is unsurpassed; a slowly growing contamination will spread panic before it, images of a desperate people quarantined by their own government sowing despair beyond the affected area.  However, care must be taken when developing such organisms to ensure they are not accidentally released.  Furthermore, utter secrecy is required to dispel the risk of damaging relations with civilians and other empires.

GRO_REMOTE_TERRAFORM_SHORT_DESC

GRO_GAIA_TRANS
Gaia Transformation

GRO_GAIA_TRANS_DESC
Theoretically, it is possible to completely predict the ecology of a single planet by mapping out its entire web of biological interdependence, both sentient and non-sentient, in fractal algorithms. In practice however, this could only be realized by constructing a vast planet-spanning network running a computer program dedicated to regulating the planet's entire biosphere. This computer would become, in effect, the brain of a new type of life - a single planetary organism, with intelligent citizens as part of its fabric, subject to the greater will.

GRO_GAIA_TRANS_SHORT_DESC
Allows Gaia Transformation

GRO_NONCORP_MAN
Non-Corporeal Manifestation

GRO_NONCORP_MAN_DESC
'''While transforming an entire population into beings of pure energy would be impractical, certain tasks are better suited to individuals able to manifest themselves non-corporeally.  Ship's crews for example, would no longer have to waste space with crew quarters or rations storage.  Beings with greater energy channeling abilities would be able to enhance planetary shields and defense, and resource production would be generally enhanced.

Increases max fuel on all ships by 2, max defense on all planets by 5, max shield on all planets by 5, target farming on all planets with the Farming focus by one quarter of the planet's population, target mining on all planets with the Mining focus by 10, target industry on all planets with the Industry focus by one quarter of the planet's population, and target research on all planets with the Research focus by one fifth.'''

LRN_OBSERVATORY_I
Observatory

LRN_OBSERVATORY_I_DESC
Studying and understanding the nature of stars and their internal and external attributes provides powerful insight into the nature of stellar phenomena and planetary bodies.  Furthermore, fractal algorithms can be employed to decipher the dispersal of starlanes throughout the galaxy, allowing any stars which are in some way connected, however indirectly, to the known network of starlanes to be identified an monitored.

LRN_SOLAR_MAN
Solar Manipulation

LRN_SOLAR_MAN_DESC
Different star types not only have their own distinct attributes and opportunities for exploitation, but also tend to give rise to a particular planet type.  Often, a star of a particular type will give a desired bonus, but will almost certainly be devoid of any desirable planets, or will not be present in an opportune location in the galaxy.  By manipulating the high-energy reactions within a star's core, it would be possible to either reverse or accelerate the natural processes within the star, allowing it to be changed to an entirely different type at need.

LRN_XENOARCH_RESTORE
Xenoarchaeological Restoration

LRN_XENOARCH_RESTORE_DESC
It is often exceedingly difficult and dangerous to decipher the clues left by ancient civilizations in the form of highly advanced technology.  Mistreatment of the technology or accidental activation can cause the technology itself and/or the archaeologists extracting the technology to be lost.  By containing the technology safely within a force field and probing its depths via non-local field manipulation, it is possible to safely recover and unlock the mysteries of ancient technology.

LRN_GATEWAY_VOID
Gateway to the Void

LRN_GATEWAY_VOID_DESC
The power of the Void Mind is almost imperceptible in a mere four-dimensional space-time.  By creating a permanent gateway accessing an immense number of dimensions, a dangerous, non-discriminating force can be unleashed in a localized area.

LRN_ENCLAVE_VOID
Enclave of the Void

LRN_ENCLAVE_VOID_DESC
Study of the Void Mind could be accelerated by genetically engineering the populace of an entire world to be attuned to the Void. This new priestly class could transform the entire social structure of their world to better understand and channel the wisdom of the Void Mind to the entire empire.

LRN_GAL_DATA_NET

PRO_HEAVY_MINING_I
Heavy Mining Processors

PRO_HEAVY_MINING_I_DESC
When increased minerals production is the only concern, no environmental damage considerations exist and the environment itself is conducive, partially automated bulk mining activities can be optimal.  Heavy mining processors are expensive however, and are only practical to use on worlds with primary focus mining.  As well, these processors severely damage the ecology of a planet, reducing it's maximum population and health somewhat.

PRO_ASTEROID_MINE
Asteroid Mining

PRO_ASTEROID_MINE_DESC
'''Mineral resource extraction from subplanetoid-sized bodies involves challenges and provides opportunities quite distinct from those of full-fledged planets.  Lacking sufficient mass to self-liquify and differentiate, asteroids can provide much easier access to some heavier elements, and lack of a gravity can make extraction for use in space much more efficient.  Conversely, the limited size of each source asteroid requires fully portable self-sufficient extraction facilities.  As well, the challenges of any microgravity environment must be overcome, requiring redesign of many traditional methods.

Permits use of the Mining focus on Asteroids.'''

PRO_ORBITAL_MINE
Orbital Mining

PRO_ORBITAL_MINE_DESC
'''On solid, habitable planets, traditional bulk surface mining is effective and relatively efficient.  For gas giants and terrestrial planets that are unable to support a sizable population however, the ability to extract usable minerals with space-based facilities is far more practical.  A primary challenge to this method is overcoming the planetary gravity well, but once this is accomplished, vast new sources of minerals become available.  As well, specialized resources on uninhabitable planets become accessible for the first time.

Permits use of the Mining focus on planetary outposts.'''

PRO_GAS_GIANT_GEN

Requires a Basic Shipyard, an Energy Compressor and a Controlled Energy Focusing Array at the planet where it is formed.'''

SH_SOLAR
Solar Hull

SH_SOLAR_DESC
'''This mighty flagship is essentially a miniature sun, and as such is a great source of both fuel and visibility.  All accompanying friendly ships completely recover fuel between combat, and all enemy ships in the vicinity receive a penalty to stealth.  This hull has eighteen external slots and nine internal slots - a far greater internal capacity than any other hull.  Structure is extremely high, but speed and stealth are very low.  However, this ship has the ability to enter a star and hide, giving it perfect stealth on the galaxy map when it is in a system with a star of type other than Black Hole or Neutron, and in combat, when it is hiding inside such a star.  This ship requires a tremendous amount of energy to construct and must harness energy from particle-antiparticle collisions on the event horizon of a Black Hole in its formation.

Requires a Basic Shipyard, an Energy Compressor and a Solar Containment Unit at the planet where it is built.'''
