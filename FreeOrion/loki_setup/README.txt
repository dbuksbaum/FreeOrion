1. Install
============
- Download the latest archiv by
   executing the following commands in a console / command-line prompt:
     cd /tmp
     wget http://psitronic.de/div/FO/latest.tar.gz
   or downloading it with your browser and put it into /tmp

- Use graphical installer:
   Unpack latest.tar.gz and run "setup.sh". The graphical
   installer will guide you.
   This will install a menu-entry and, if installing as root,
   a binary "freeorion-start" into your path.
     cd /tmp
     tar xfz latest.tar.gz
     sudo freeorion/setup.sh


   Or you may unpack latest.tar.gz anywhere on your system
   and use it directly. e.g.:
     cd /usr/local/games
     tar xfz /tmp/latest.tar.gz
  Then you can execute /usr/local/games/freeorion/freeorion
  to run the game
